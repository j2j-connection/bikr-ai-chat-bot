2. **Email lookup** ‚Üí Instantly shows service history from Lightspeed
3. **AI cross-references** ‚Üí "Last brake service was 8 months ago"

5. **Instant estimate** ‚Üí "Brake pad replacement: $45 total (20 min)"
6. **Service booking** ‚Üí Creates estimate in Lightspeed

### What Your Staff Will See

## üåê Website Integration (Floating Chat Bubble)

Add BikeBot to your website with a floating chat bubble that opens an embedded iframe.

### 1) Paste this snippet before </body>

```html
<script>
  (function () {
    var w = 420, h = 650;
    var btn = document.createElement('div');
    btn.style.cssText = 'position:fixed;bottom:20px;right:20px;background:#10b981;color:#fff;'
      + 'width:56px;height:56px;border-radius:9999px;display:flex;align-items:center;'
      + 'justify-content:center;cursor:pointer;box-shadow:0 10px 25px rgba(0,0,0,.15);z-index:999999;';
    btn.innerHTML = 'üí¨';
    document.body.appendChild(btn);

    var wrap = document.createElement('div');
    wrap.style.cssText = 'position:fixed;bottom:88px;right:20px;width:'+w+'px;height:'+h+'px;'
      + 'border-radius:14px;overflow:hidden;box-shadow:0 15px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.2);'
      + 'display:none;background:#fff;z-index:999998;';

    var iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
    iframe.src = 'https://YOUR-BOT-DOMAIN.com/?shop=YOUR_DOMAIN_PREFIX&embed=1';
    iframe.style.cssText = 'width:100%;height:100%;border:0;';
    iframe.allow = 'clipboard-write; microphone; camera';
    wrap.appendChild(iframe);
    document.body.appendChild(wrap);

    btn.onclick = function(){
      wrap.style.display = (wrap.style.display==='none' || !wrap.style.display) ? 'block' : 'none';
    };
  })();
</script>
```

Replace:
- `YOUR-BOT-DOMAIN.com` with your BikeBot hosted domain
- `YOUR_DOMAIN_PREFIX` with your Lightspeed domain prefix (e.g., `mystore` from mystore.retail.lightspeed.app)

### 2) Where to add it
- WordPress: Appearance ‚Üí Theme File Editor ‚Üí `footer.php` (before `</body>`), or use a ‚ÄúCustom HTML‚Äù block on the specific page.
- Shopify: Online Store ‚Üí Themes ‚Üí Edit Code ‚Üí `layout/theme.liquid` (before `</body>`), or add a ‚ÄúCustom Liquid/HTML‚Äù section to the desired template.
- Squarespace / Wix / Webflow: Add an ‚ÄúEmbed/HTML‚Äù block to the site footer or target page and paste the snippet.

### 3) Security/CSP notes
- If you use a strict Content-Security-Policy, allow frame embedding for your bot domain: `frame-src https://YOUR-BOT-DOMAIN.com;` and `connect-src` as needed.
- Ensure your site does not set `X-Frame-Options: DENY` for the bot domain.
- All requests are over HTTPS.

### 4) Optional theming
- You can append query params for simple branding, e.g. `&brand=YourShop&theme=light` and read them in your hosted bot if supported.

This approach lets you deploy BikeBot on any CMS or custom site with a single snippet, while keeping Lightspeed OAuth and data access managed in your BikeBot dashboard.
